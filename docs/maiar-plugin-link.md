# Maiar and Plugin Integration

This Lovable project uses the Maiar AI framework and its plugin system:

- **Maiar**: A plugin-based AI framework by Uranium Corporation ([GitHub](https://github.com/UraniumCorporation/maiar-ai)).
- **Plugins**: Leverages Maiar’s plugin registry ([GitHub](https://github.com/UraniumCorporation/plugin-registry)) for NFT generation.
- **Purpose**: The "Create NFT" page sends skills to a Maiar-powered API, which uses plugins to create NFT concepts.

Work is ongoing to fully link this frontend to Maiar’s backend runtime.
